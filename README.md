Life expectancy at birth is an estimate of how long a person born today would live, on average, if current mortality rates in every age group remained constant throughout the personâ€™s life. It is a way to summarize current mortality rates in an easily understood measure to which most people can directly relate.

Life expectancy is affected by many factors such as socioeconomic status, including employment, income, education and economic wellbeing; the quality of the health system and the ability of people to access it; health behaviors such as tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, poor nutrition and lack of exercise; social factors; genetic factors; and environmental factors including overcrowded housing, lack of clean drinking water and adequate sanitation, and hence it is a way to summarise current mortality rates, and other factors which mentioned above in an easily understood measure to which most people can directly relate.
